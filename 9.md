# File I/O

In this lesson, we will learn how to read from and write to files in Java. File I/O (Input/Output) is a way to handle files in your programs. This is useful when you want to save data or read data from a file.

## Reading Files

To read a file in Java, we can use the `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` classes. Here is a simple example:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("example.txt");
            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
            
            String line;
            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            
            bufferedReader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `FileReader` object to read from a file called "example.txt". We then create a `BufferedReader` object to read the file line by line. The `readLine()` method returns the next line from the file, or `null` if there are no more lines. We print each line to the console using `System.out.println()`. Finally, we close the `BufferedReader` to free up system resources.

## Writing Files

To write to a file in Java, we can use the `FileWriter` and `BufferedWriter` classes. Here is a simple example:

```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WriteFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("example.txt");
            BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(fileWriter);
            
            bufferedWriter.write("Hello, World!");
            bufferedWriter.newLine();
            bufferedWriter.write("This is a test file.");
            
            bufferedWriter.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error writing file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `FileWriter` object to write to a file called "example.txt". We then create a `BufferedWriter` object to write to the file. The `write()` method writes a string to the file, and the `newLine()` method writes a newline character to the file. Finally, we close the `BufferedWriter` to free up system resources.

Remember to handle exceptions when working with files, as they can throw `IOExceptions` if there is an error reading or writing the file.
