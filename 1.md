# Introduction to Java

## What is Java?

Java is a popular programming language that is used to create all kinds of software, from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems. It is known for being easy to learn and use, which makes it a great choice for beginners.

### Key Features of Java:
- **Simple**: Java is designed to be easy to understand and write.
- **Object-Oriented**: Java uses objects to represent data and methods to manipulate that data.
- **Platform-Independent**: Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Setting Up Java

Before we can start writing Java programs, we need to set up our computer to run Java.

### Steps to Set Up Java:
1. **Download and Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Go to the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
   - Download the latest version of JDK for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
   - Follow the installation instructions.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - You can use any text editor to write Java code, but it's easier to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
   - Download and install your preferred IDE.

## Your First Java Program

Let's write our first Java program! We'll create a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

### Steps to Write Your First Program:
1. **Open Your IDE**:
   - Open the IDE you installed (Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - In your IDE, create a new Java project. Name it `HelloWorld`.

3. **Create a New Java Class**:
   - Inside your project, create a new Java class. Name it `HelloWorld`.

4. **Write the Code**:
   - Copy and paste the following code into your `HelloWorld` class:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- `public class HelloWorld`: This line declares a new class named `HelloWorld`.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This line declares the main method. This is where the program starts running.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

5. **Run Your Program**:
   - In your IDE, find the option to run your program. You should see "Hello, World!" printed on the screen.

Congratulations! You've just written and run your first Java program. Great job!
