# Control Flow

Control flow in Java allows you to control the order in which your code runs. This is important for making decisions and repeating actions in your programs. Let's learn about conditional statements and loops!

## Conditional Statements (if, else)

Conditional statements let your program make decisions based on certain conditions.

### Example: Using `if` and `else`
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 10;

        if (age < 13) {
            System.out.println("You are a child.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are a teenager or an adult.");
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the program checks if `age` is less than 13. If it is, it prints "You are a child." Otherwise, it prints "You are a teenager or an adult."

## Loops (for, while)

Loops let your program repeat actions multiple times.

### Example: Using a `for` loop
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("This is loop number: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `for` loop runs 5 times, printing the loop number each time.

### Example: Using a `while` loop
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 1;
        while (i <= 5) {
            System.out.println("This is loop number: " + i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `while` loop also runs 5 times, printing the loop number each time.

## Break and Continue Statements

These statements help control the flow inside loops.

### Example: Using `break`
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) {
                break; // Exit the loop when i is 3
            }
            System.out.println("This is loop number: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the loop stops when `i` is 3.

### Example: Using `continue`
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if (i == 3) {
                continue; // Skip the rest of the loop when i is 3
            }
            System.out.println("This is loop number: " + i);
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the loop skips printing when `i` is 3 but continues with the next numbers.
