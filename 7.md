# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! OOP is a way to organize your code by creating objects that represent real-world things. This makes your code easier to understand and manage. Let's dive into the basics of OOP with simple examples.

## Classes and Objects

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.

### Example: Creating a Class and an Object
```java
public class Dog {
    String name;
    int age;

    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog(); // Create an object of the Dog class
        myDog.name = "Buddy";
        myDog.age = 3;
        myDog.bark(); // Call the bark method
    }
}
```
In this example, we created a `Dog` class with attributes `name` and `age`, and a method `bark`. Then, we created an object `myDog` and used it to call the `bark` method.

## Methods and Attributes

Methods are actions that objects can perform, and attributes are the characteristics of the objects.

### Example: Using Methods and Attributes
```java
public class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car(); // Create an object of the Car class
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.speed = 100;
        myCar.drive(); // Call the drive method
    }
}
```
In this example, we created a `Car` class with attributes `color` and `speed`, and a method `drive`. Then, we created an object `myCar` and used it to call the `drive` method.

## Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

### Example: Using Inheritance
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Meow! Meow!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat myCat = new Cat(); // Create an object of the Cat class
        myCat.eat(); // Call the inherited eat method
        myCat.meow(); // Call the meow method
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Cat` class inherits the `eat` method from the `Animal` class and also has its own `meow` method.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

### Example: Using Polymorphism
```java
class Bird {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("This bird makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Sparrow extends Bird {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Chirp! Chirp!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird myBird = new Sparrow(); // Create an object of the Sparrow class
        myBird.sound(); // Call the sound method
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Sparrow` class overrides the `sound` method of the `Bird` class. When we call the `sound` method on a `Bird` reference that points to a `Sparrow` object, it calls the overridden method in the `Sparrow` class.
