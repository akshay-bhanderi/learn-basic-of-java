# Multithreading

Multithreading is a way to make your Java programs do multiple things at the same time. Imagine you are doing your homework while listening to music. You are doing two tasks at once. In Java, we can use threads to do this.

## Introduction to Multithreading

A thread is like a small part of a program that can run independently. When you run a Java program, it starts with one main thread. You can create more threads to do other tasks at the same time.

### Why Use Multithreading?

- **Efficiency**: It makes your program run faster by doing multiple tasks at once.
- **Responsiveness**: It keeps your program responsive. For example, a game can keep running while it loads new levels in the background.

## Creating Threads

There are two main ways to create threads in Java:

1. **Extending the `Thread` class**
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**

### Example 1: Extending the `Thread` Class

```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("This is a thread running.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new class `MyThread` that extends the `Thread` class. We override the `run` method to define what the thread will do. Then, we create an instance of `MyThread` and call the `start` method to run the thread.

### Example 2: Implementing the `Runnable` Interface

```java
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("This is a thread running.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
        Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new class `MyRunnable` that implements the `Runnable` interface. We override the `run` method to define what the thread will do. Then, we create an instance of `MyRunnable` and pass it to a new `Thread` object. Finally, we call the `start` method to run the thread.

## Thread Synchronization

Sometimes, multiple threads need to share resources, like a variable or a file. If they try to use the resource at the same time, it can cause problems. Thread synchronization helps to prevent these problems.

### Example: Synchronized Method

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class SyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Counter` class with a synchronized `increment` method. This ensures that only one thread can increment the count at a time. We create two threads that both increment the counter 1000 times. By using `join`, we wait for both threads to finish before printing the final count.

## Summary

Multithreading allows your Java programs to do multiple tasks at the same time. You can create threads by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. Thread synchronization helps to manage shared resources safely. With these tools, you can make your programs more efficient and responsive.

Happy coding!
