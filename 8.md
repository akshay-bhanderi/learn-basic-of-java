# Basic Projects

Welcome to the final section of our Java course! In this section, we'll put everything you've learned into practice by creating some fun and simple projects. Let's get started!

## Creating a Simple Calculator

Let's create a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

### Example Code

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter first number:");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter second number:");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Choose an operation: +, -, *, /");
        char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        double result = 0;

        switch (operation) {
            case '+':
                result = num1 + num2;
                break;
            case '-':
                result = num1 - num2;
                break;
            case '*':
                result = num1 * num2;
                break;
            case '/':
                result = num1 / num2;
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid operation!");
                return;
        }

        System.out.println("The result is: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Scanner**: We use `Scanner` to get input from the user.
2. **Get Numbers**: We ask the user to enter two numbers.
3. **Choose Operation**: The user chooses an operation (+, -, *, /).
4. **Calculate Result**: We use a `switch` statement to perform the chosen operation.
5. **Display Result**: We print the result of the calculation.

## Building a Basic Game

Let's create a simple guessing game where the computer picks a random number, and the player has to guess it.

### Example Code

```java
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GuessingGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random random = new Random();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int numberToGuess = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
        int numberOfTries = 0;
        int guess;
        boolean win = false;

        System.out.println("Guess a number between 1 and 100:");

        while (!win) {
            guess = scanner.nextInt();
            numberOfTries++;

            if (guess < numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Too low! Try again.");
            } else if (guess > numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Too high! Try again.");
            } else {
                win = true;
                System.out.println("Correct! You win!");
                System.out.println("It took you " + numberOfTries + " tries.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Random and Scanner**: We use `Random` to generate a random number and `Scanner` to get input from the user.
2. **Generate Random Number**: The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
3. **Guessing Loop**: The player guesses the number, and we give hints if the guess is too low or too high.
4. **Win Condition**: If the player guesses correctly, we congratulate them and show the number of tries.

## Summary

Great job! You've created a simple calculator and a fun guessing game. These projects help you practice the basics of Java programming. Keep experimenting and building more projects to improve your skills.
